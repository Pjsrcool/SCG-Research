# Contents
- Notes folder contains information about the contents in this repo and its relevant information. There is also a folder for outdated notes. I want to keep those for future reference.
- scripts folder currently contains the puppeteer scripts recorded the recorder feature in Google Chrome

# Setup
- Automatically clone all benchmark projects by running `python Utilities/CloneProjects.py`
- links to benchmark projects are in Notes/_projects_list.txt
- We use Jalangi2 to convert projects into ES5 through a proxy. Link to the repo is <a href="https://github.com/Pjsrcool/jalangi2">here</a>



# To Do
- learn more Babel and webpack
- get more projects to successfully compile to es5 automatially using mitmproxy and Jalangi2
- try to increase code coverage in recordings to 50% +
- figure out how to play puppeteer scripts through Jalangi2
