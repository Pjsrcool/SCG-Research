when exporting a puppeteeer script from Google Chrome,
update the browser launch parameter to include:

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: false })

otherwise, the browser will not launch and show a live
replay. default {headless : true}, which runs the replay
int he background

in .env, add BROSWER=none to disable browser from automatically
starting when running project

Babel:
install babel per project and make "es5" branch
npm install -D babel-core
npm install -D babel-cli
npm install -D babel-preset-env
create .babelrc with 

{
    "presets" : ["env"]
}

add in scripts
"es5": "babel src -d src",





todo:
learn difference between es5 and es6
make sure everything works in ES5
learn Babel and webpack
compile es6 to es5
try to increase code coverage in recordings to 50% +
put everything in github
