These examples are already compiled. To run them, we us a script from Madhurima.

**To run each project**
1. Make sure you are in this repo's root directory
2. Run `node Utilities/serveTodo.js <directory>`

Replace `<directory>` with the absolute path to the example you want to run. Check the list below for the specific path used for each example. The beginning of each path is removed because it will be different on each person's computer. For example, if I wanted to run `angular2` on my computer, the command I would run is `node Utilities/serveTodo.js /home/justin/SCG-Research/Projects/todomvc/examples/angular2`
