For all 5 projects above:
if I ran the project using "npm run start", then mitmproxy will 
have an error with the following traceback:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "scripts/proxy.py", line 73, in processFile
    with open (instrumentedFileName, 'r') as file:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'cache/192.168.1.10/74fc559b34881a220f296e905c872cd8/bundle_jalangi_.js'

Otherwise, I can confirm that jalangi2 BranchCoverage.js runs. The 
"Jalangi" button still appears as expected, and I can view the
results of the instrumentation by clicking on the "Jalangi" button.
